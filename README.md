This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: modifying a vector's contents through a raw pointer after potential reallocation.  The `bug.rs` file showcases the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a safe and correct approach using proper Rust techniques.  Always prioritize memory safety when working with raw pointers in Rust.
